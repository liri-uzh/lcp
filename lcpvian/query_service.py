query_service.py: control submission of RQ jobs

We use RQ/Redis for long-running DB queries. The QueryService class has a method
for each type of DB query that we need to run (query, sentence-query, upload,
create schema, store query, delete_query, fetch query, etc.). Jobs are run by a dedicated
worker process.

After the job is complete, callback functions can be run by worker for success and
failure. Typically, these callbacks will post-process the data and publish it
to Redis PubSub, which we listen on in the main process so we can send
the data to user via websocket.

Before submitting jobs to RQ/Redis, we can often hash the incoming job data to
create an identifier for the job. If identical input data is provided in a
subsequent job, the same hash will be generated, So, we can check in Redis for
this job ID; if it's available, we can trigger the callback manually, and thus
save ourselves from running duplicate DB queries.
