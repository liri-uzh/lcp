# *Videoscope*

The _VideoScope_ interface is optimized for querying, analyzing and visualizing audio data. If you work with, e.g., videoconference recordings or want to focus on the video aspects of a multimodal corpus, _VideoScope_ is most efficient. 


## Landing page 
The landing page of _VideoScope_ is designed in the same way as the main LCP page, but only lists corpora that contain video data. Audio- and text-only corpora are not shown here.

</p>


## Data tab

In _VideoScope_ (and in _Soundscript_), the _Data_ tab is shown first, to allow for browsing though the media and annotations before querying.

### Media Player

In _VideoScope_, the media player can show up to four video and audio channels for a single document.

</p>

### Timeline

The timeline previews time-aligned transcripts and other annotations in layers. You can click and drag the timeline left and right to view annotations. You can hover annotation bars to see more information associated to that element.

</p>


## Query tab

The _Query_ tab is designed the same way across all interfaces. It contains the query entry field and the corpus template preview. Each corpus typically comes with a default query as assistance. Move and magnify the corpus template for a better overview.

For more information on querying see the [Querying](querying.md) page and the [DQD](dqd.md) page.

### Results

Once the query has been submitted, results will automatically show in the _Data_ tab, below the player. Pressing the play &#9658; button will start playing back the media from the position in the document for the corresponding line.
