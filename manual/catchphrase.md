# *catchphrase*

The _catchphrase_ interface is optimized for querying, analyzing and visualizing textual data. If you work with text corpora or focus on the textual aspects of a multimodal corpus, _catchphrase_ is most efficient.

## The landing page 
The landing page of _catchphrase_ is designed in the same way as the main LCP page, but allows access only to the textual part of the corpora. In case of multimodal corpora, the annotations will be included, but not the media.

## Query tab

The _Query_ tab is designed the same way across all interfaces. It contains the query entry field and the corpus template preview. Each corpus typically comes with a default query for illustration purposes. Move and magnify the corpus template for a better overview.

For more information on querying, see the [Querying](querying.md) page and the [DQD](dqd.md) page.

## Results / Data tab

Once the query has been submitted, results will show in the _Data_ tab.

### Analyses
If your query includes analyses, you will see corresponding anslyses tabs, where you can sort the results based on column values. Variables shown here depend on the definition in the DQD query.

<div style="padding: 0.5em; margin: 1em 0em; background-color: rgb(237,245,253); color: black; border-radius: 0.2em;">
<span style="color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;">( ! ) </span>
<strong>Pro tip:</strong> if you sort by one column and then press another column header while holding the Shift button, you can sort based on two columns.
</div>

### Collocations

Here you can see the statistics regarding collocations for the chosen settings from the DQD query.
