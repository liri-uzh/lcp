# *LCP Landing Page*


The landing page of LCP is a gateway to all the corpora and interfaces. The default modality of the corpus is shown by the color of the tile: <span style="color: teal; font-weight: bold;">teal</span> for <span style="color: teal; font-weight: bold;">text</span>/catchphrase, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">blue</span> for <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">audio</span>/soundscript, <span style="color: purple; font-weight: bold;">purple</span> for <span style="color: purple; font-weight: bold;">video</span>/videoscope.

The default interface will open by pressing on the query button. However, by hovering the query button the user can choose an alternative interface to view or query the corpus, e.g., open video corpora in catchphrase witout the media files.

This tile design also applies to the landing page of each interface, although specific interfaces may only show a subset of corpora (e.g., VideoScope will show only video corpora).
