# Import Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to import subtitled video files into LCP. The first part presents a conceptual overview and the second part applies the logic to the data.

## Files

The video files and their timed transcripts can be downloaded here: https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/v3uxBpNkeYuyPE2

Note that none of the Python scripts in this tutorial requires the video files, so you can decide to only download the .srt files. The video files will only be required at the end of part 2, in order to successfully upload the data to _videoScope_.
