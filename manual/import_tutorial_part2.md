# Part 2: Processing the data

## Setup

Make sure you have `lcpcli` installed in your local python environment:

```bash
pip install lcpcli==0.2.2
```

The `lcpcli` library provides us with a tool to help us build LCP corpora in python.

## Corpus builder

At the simplest level, creating an LCP corpus requires very few steps:

```python
from lcpcli.builder import Corpus

corpus = Corpus("my corpus")
corpus.Document(
    corpus.Segment(
        corpus.Token("Hello"),
        corpus.Token("world")
    )
)
corpus.make()
```

The lines above will create a text-only corpus consisting of only one document, with only one segment, with two tokens whose forms are `Hello` and `world`.

The last line, `c.make()`, builds and outputs files for upload in the current directory.

Our implementation will be a little more sophisticated than this hello-world example, in that we will have multiple segments and two documents, but the basic idea will remain the same.


## Segmentation and Tokenization

The `Corpus` class allows us to define arbitrary names instead of `Token`, `Segment` and `Document`. In this tutorial, we will use the more common (albeit less technical) terms `Word`, `Sentence` and `Clip` instead:

```python
corpus = Corpus(
    "Tutorial corpus",
    document="Clip",
    segment="Sentence",
    token="Word"
)
```

To start with, we will only process one SRT file, `database_explorer.srt`, so we will only create a single clip in the corpus, using `clip = corpus.Clip()`

A first rough approach would be to treat every non-empty line of the SRT file as a segment and split it by space to get words:

```python
clip = corpus.Clip()

with open("database_explorer.srt", "r") as input:
    while line := input.readline():
        line = line.strip()
        if not line:
            continue
        clip.Sentence(*[
            corpus.Word(w.strip())
            for w in line.split(" ")
            if w.strip()
        ])

clip.make()
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that `.Sentence` can be called either on `clip`, as in this snippet, or on `corpus`, which is the method used in the hello-world example (resp. `.Segment`). In the hello-world, the segment is created directly as an argument of `corpus.Document` and, as such, belongs to it; here, the script does not pass sentences as direct arguments of the clip; instead, the sentences are created on the fly, which why it is necessary to call `.Sentence` on `clip`.
{% endhint %}

Although functional, the snippet above outputs unusable data: becaue each line is mapped to one sentence, some will consist just of a block number, some of timestamps, and many actually correspond to chunks of sentences distributed over multiple transcriptoin blocks.

[This commented python script](https://github.com/liri-uzh/lcp_tutorial/blob/main/first_pass/convert.py) extends the logic illustrated in the snippet to ignore the transcription block numbers and timestamps, and uses sentence delimiters for segmentation instead of mapping one line to one sentence:

 - If the line reports a block number or the block's timestamps, it is ignored
 - If the line is a linebreak, the next two lines are flagged as a block number and its timestamps
 - If the line has some text, it is split by sentence delimiters (`.`, `!`, `?`) and each resulting chunk is in turn split by token delimiters (` `, `,`, `'`); the resulting word is added to the current sentence

Whenever the script hits a sentence delimiter, it creates a new sentence with `sentence = clip.Sentence()`, and whenever it processes a word, it adds it to the current sentence with `sentence.Word(w)`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The same is true of `.Sentence` and `.Word`: each can be called on `corpus` or on their parent (respectively, `clip` and `segment`) depending on whether you decide to pass them as direct arguments of their parent.
{% endhint %}

## Import

Visit [catchphrase](https://catchphrase.linguistik.uzh.ch) and create a new corpus collection, then open its setting by clicking the gear icon, click the "API" tab and create a new API key; write down the key and the secret.

Open a terminal and run the following command, replacing `path/to/output` with a path pointing to the folder containing the files generated by the script, `$API_KEY` with the key you just got, `$API_SECRET` with the secret you just got and `$PROJECT` with the name of the collection you just created:

`lcpcli -c path/to/output/ -k $API_KEY -s $API_SECRET -p "$PROJECT" --live`

You should get a confirmation message, and your corpus should now be visible in your collection after you refresh the page!


## Multiple documents

To parse multilpe SRT files, the edits to the script are minimal: one just needs to iterate over the SRT files to create a dedicated instance of `Clip` for each, and one can also report the name of the file for reference purposes, as in: `clip = corpus.Clip(name="database_explorer")`.

{% hint style="info" %}
One can pass arbitrary keyword arguments to define attributes, as illustrated here with `name="database_explorer"`. Another option is to set the attribute on the instance, as in `clip.name = "database_explorer"`. This applies to all entities, not just to documents.
{% endhint %}

An updated version of the script that processes all the SRT documents in the working directory can be found [here](https://github.com/liri-uzh/lcp_tutorial/blob/main/all_documents/convert.py).

## Adding annotations

For the sake of illustration, we will now add two pieces of annotation:
 - one at the sentence level, reporting the original text of each sentence, i.e. including the token-delimiter characters
 - one at the word level, reporting whether each word was preceded by a single quote

An updated python script that does that can be found [here](https://github.com/liri-uzh/lcp_tutorial/blob/main/original_shortened/convert.py).

The original text of the sentence is set as `sentence.original = original` (where `original` is a string containing the original text) and whether a word is preceded by `'` is set when creating the word instance, as in `sentence.Word(word, shortened=shortened)` (where `shortened` is appropriately set to `"yes"` or `"no"`).


## Time alignment and video

Associating a document with a video only takes one command: `clip.set_media("clip", "database_explorer.mp4")`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The first argument of `set_media` is a string defining the name of the _media slot_ for the media file. Unlike this corpus, some video corpora can have more than one video per document; for example, scenes could be filmed from two different angles in parallel, resulting in two video files per document, so that one media slot could be named `"left"` and the other `"right"`.
{% endhint %}

The challenging part is time alignment. Command-wise, it again only takes one line to align a segment: `sentence.set_time(0, 25)`. This would align the sentence from 0s to 1s (remember that LCP uses a convention of 25 frames per second).

We will use the timestamps of the transcription blocks to time-align the sentences, while leaving the words unaligned. Because **some sentences can span multiple blocks**, and **each block can contain more than one sentence**, we have to be smart about it: only when we hit a sentence delimiter do we use the start timecode of the block as the start of the _next_ sentence, otherwise we need to use the start timecode of the _first_ block in which the sentence starts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Because we process multiple videos, we also need to offset the time-alignment of each successive clip by the duration of the preceding ones. Failing to do so would cause sentences _from different video clips_ to overlap in LCP, which would undermine the value of time-based queries.
{% endhint %}

An updated python script that implements time alignment can be found [here](https://github.com/liri-uzh/lcp_tutorial/blob/main/video/convert.py). 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to [download](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/v3uxBpNkeYuyPE2) and place the files `database_explorer.mp4` and `presenter_pro.mp4` in your folder so they can be included in the output folder and uploaded to _videoScope_.

(The MP4 files next to `convert.py` in the repository are empty, placeholder files and will not play back in _videoScope_.)
